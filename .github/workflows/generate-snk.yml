      # Generate a snake game SVG from my GitHub contributions graph
      - name: Generate gh-contribution-snk.svg
      - uses: Platane/snk/svg-only@v2
        with:
          github_user_name: ${{ github.repository_owner }}

          # list of files to generate.
          # one file per line. Each output can be customized with options as query string.
          #
          #  supported options:
          #  - palette:     A preset of color, one of [github, github-dark, github-light]
          #  - color_snake: Color of the snake
          #  - color_dots:  Coma separated list of dots color.
          #                 The first one is 0 contribution, then it goes from the low contribution to the highest.
          #                 Exactly 5 colors are expected.
